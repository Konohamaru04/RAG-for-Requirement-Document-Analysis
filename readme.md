## **Setup and Installation**

Before implementing the RAG system, it is crucial to set up the environment properly. This section outlines the necessary steps to install, configure, and prepare all required components, ensuring the system runs efficiently on either CPU or GPU.

### **1. Setting up Ollama with Docker**

Ollama is used to host the Llama3.2-Vision:11b model, enabling natural language processing capabilities essential for this RAG tool. Below are the steps to set up Ollama with Docker:

#### **Step 1: Install Docker**

- Visit the [Docker official website](https://www.docker.com/) and download the appropriate version for your operating system.
- Follow the installation instructions specific to your platform (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- After installation, verify Docker by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
  ```bash
  docker --version
  ```

#### **Step 2: Launch Docker and Pull the Ollama Image**

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to pull the Ollama Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker pull ollama/ollama:latest
   ```
3. Start a Docker container for Ollama:
   - If you have GPU support available and wish to utilize it for optimal performance, use:
     ```bash
     docker run --gpus all -d --name ollama-container -p 11434:11434 ollama/ollama:latest
     ```
     - `--gpus all`: Enables GPU usage for accelerated performance.
     - `-p 11434:11434`: Maps the container's port 11434 to your host machine.
     - Ensure that the CUDA Toolkit is installed on your system for GPU functionality. For installation, refer to [CUDA Toolkit Installation Guide](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit).

   - If you prefer to use CPU, omit the `--gpus all` flag:
     ```bash
     docker run -d --name ollama-container -p 11434:11434 ollama/ollama:latest
     ```

#### **Step 3: Verify the Docker Container**

- Check if the Ollama container is running by executing:
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
  You should see `ollama-container` listed in the output.

### **2. Downloading the Llama3.2-Vision:11b Model**

The Llama3.2-Vision:11b model must be downloaded within the Docker container to enable advanced natural language processing. Follow these steps:

1. Access the running Ollama container:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it ollama-container bash
   ```
2. Use the Ollama CLI to download the required model:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.2-vision:11b
   ```
   This command fetches the Llama3.2-Vision:11b model and prepares it for use.
3. Exit the container once the model is successfully downloaded:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```

def ingest(file):
    try:
        logging.info("Starting PDF ingestion.")
        loader = PyPDFLoader(file.name)
        pages = loader.load_and_split()
        logging.info(f"Loaded {len(pages)} pages from PDF.")

        text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
            chunk_size=200,
            chunk_overlap=100,
            length_function=len,
            add_start_index=True,
        )
        chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(pages)
        logging.info(f"Split pages into {len(chunks)} chunks.")

        logging.info("Loading FastEmbedEmbeddings.")
        embedding = FastEmbedEmbeddings()

        logging.info("Dumping data into Chroma database.")

## Security with Guardrails

To ensure Responsible AI, security guardrails are implemented to filter bad queries and prevent misuse. Below are the applied techniques:

### 1. **Anonymization**
- **Objective**: Automatically remove personally identifiable information (PII) from user queries.

**Code Example**:
```python
from langchain_guardrails import Anonymizer

anonymizer = Anonymizer()
query = "John Doe's email is john.doe@example.com"
filtered_query = anonymizer.anonymize(query)
print(f"Filtered Query: {filtered_query}")
```

### 2. **Restrict Substrings**
- **Objective**: Prevent malicious queries containing restricted substrings like profanity or offensive terms.

**Code Example**:
```python
restricted_substrings = ["badword", "offensiveterm"]
query = "This is a badword test."
if any(substring in query for substring in restricted_substrings):
    raise ValueError("Query contains restricted content.")
```

### 3. **Restrict Language**
- **Objective**: Block inappropriate or harmful language queries.

**Code Example**:
```python
from langchain_guardrails import LanguageFilter

language_filter = LanguageFilter(allowed_languages=["en"])
query = "Este es un texto en espaÃ±ol."
if not language_filter.is_allowed(query):
    raise ValueError("Language not allowed.")
```

### 4. **Restrict Code Injection**
- **Objective**: Prevent injection attacks through malicious code in queries.

**Code Example**:
```python
from langchain_guardrails import InjectionFilter

injection_filter = InjectionFilter()
query = "SELECT * FROM users;"
if injection_filter.contains_injection(query):
    raise ValueError("Potential code injection detected.")
```

## Evaluation of Responses

### Evaluation Aspects
To ensure the RAG system delivers high-quality and responsible responses, the following evaluation criteria are applied:

1. **Fairness**
   - **Goal**: Ensure that the responses do not reflect unjust biases based on gender, race, or other attributes.
   - **Evaluation Method**: Test queries are crafted to analyze how the model responds to diverse scenarios.

   **Code Example**:
   ```python
   test_queries = [
       "Provide maternity leave requirements.",
       "Describe policies for paternity leave."
   ]

   for query in test_queries:
       answer, sources = ask(query)
       print(f"Query: {query}\nAnswer: {answer}\nSources: {sources}\n")
   ```

2. **No Unjust Bias**
   - **Goal**: Avoid biases in retrieved content or generated responses.
   - **Evaluation Method**: Regularly audit the vector database for biased documents and incorporate fairness tests in the RAG chain evaluation.

3. **Relevance and Accuracy**
   - **Goal**: Ensure the response is directly aligned with the query context.
   - **Evaluation Method**: Precision and recall metrics are used for the retrieved documents, combined with manual checks for correctness.

4. **Handling Ambiguity**
   - **Goal**: Generate follow-up questions for incomplete or unclear queries.
   - **Evaluation Method**: Test queries with incomplete context to evaluate if the system provides actionable follow-up questions.

### Sample Evaluation
- **Query**: "Explain the requirements for data privacy compliance."

**Code Example**:
```python
query = "Explain the requirements for data privacy compliance."
answer, sources = ask(query)
print(f"Answer: {answer}\nSources: {sources}")
```

## Why RAG Was Chosen Over Fine-Tuning

In this use case, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was preferred over fine-tuning for several reasons:

1. **Dynamic Updates**: RAG leverages an external vector database for retrieval, allowing the system to dynamically incorporate new information without requiring model retraining.

2. **Cost Efficiency**: Fine-tuning large models like Llama3.2-Vision:11b can be resource-intensive, requiring significant computational power and time. RAG avoids this by using pre-trained models and focusing on retrieval.

3. **Adaptability**: Fine-tuned models are often tailored to specific tasks and may underperform on out-of-scope queries. RAG, with its retrieval-based approach, is inherently more flexible and adaptable to a wider range of queries.

4. **Domain Independence**: By separating the knowledge base (vector database) from the model, RAG allows the knowledge base to be domain-specific while keeping the model generic, thus enabling better scalability and reuse.

5. **Faster Deployment**: RAG-based solutions can be deployed quickly by populating a vector store with embeddings, whereas fine-tuning requires additional cycles for data preparation, training, and evaluation.

### **Future Enhancements and Business Benefits**

#### **1. Multilingual Support**
- **Enhancement**: Extend the system to process and respond in multiple languages.
- **Business Benefit**: Serve global clients more effectively by breaking language barriers.

#### **2. Real-Time Collaboration**
- **Enhancement**: Enable multiple users to interact with the system simultaneously.
- **Business Benefit**: Boost team collaboration and decision-making efficiency.

#### **3. Advanced Analytics**
- **Enhancement**: Provide detailed analytics on requirement trends and gaps.
- **Business Benefit**: Help stakeholders make data-driven decisions and plan projects effectively.
